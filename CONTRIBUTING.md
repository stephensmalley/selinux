# Contributing to SELinux

Contributing to the SELinux userspace project is a similar process to
other open source projects. Bug reports, new features to the existing
code, additional tools, or updated documentation are all welcome.

You can find a list of open issues to the SELinux userspace code at
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/issues

See the SELinux kernel [Getting Started](https://github.com/selinuxproject/selinux-kernel/wiki/Getting-Started)
guide if you want to contribute to SELinux kernel development instead.

## Mailing list

SELinux has a public mailing list for developers, subscribe by sending an email to
[selinux+subscribe@vger.kernel.org](mailto:selinux+subscribe@vger.kernel.org).
It is generally wise to read relevant postings to the list before beginning any
area of new work. Searchable mailing list archives are available externally at
https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/ . Patches for SELinux are tracked via
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/selinux/list/ .

## IRC

An unofficial SELinux IRC channel is
[\#selinux](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#selinux) on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).

## Reporting Bugs

All bugs and patches should be submitted to the
[SELinux mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/selinux) at
[selinux@vger.kernel.org](mailto:selinux@vger.kernel.org).

When reporting bugs please include versions of SELinux related libraries and
tools (libsepol, libselinux, libsemanage, checkpolicy). If you are
using a custom policy please include it as well.

## Compiling

There are a number of dependencies required to build the userspace
tools/libraries. Consult the [README.md](https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/main/README.md)
for the current list of dependencies and how to build the userspace code.

## Contributing Code

After cloning the code of the repository (see below), create a patch against the
repository, and post that patch to the
[SELinux mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/selinux) at
[selinux@vger.kernel.org](mailto:selinux@vger.kernel.org).
When preparing patches, please follow these guidelines:

-   Patches should apply with git am
-   Must apply against HEAD of the main branch
-   Separate large patches into logical patches
-   Patch descriptions must end with your "Signed-off-by" line. This means your
    code meets the Developer's certificate of origin, see below.
-   C code should be formatted with clang-format, using the .clang-format
    configuration file at the root of this repository. The targets `format` and
    `check-format` are provided by the top-level Makefile for convenience.

When adding new, large features or tools it is best to discuss the
design on the mailing list prior to submitting the patch.

## Development Repository

To get a copy of the SELinux userland repository you can
run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux.git
